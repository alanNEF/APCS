# Minesweeper

In your main program, create an intermediate minesweeper (http://minesweeperonline.com/#) 16x16 with 40 mines.    The mines should be randomly placed.   You must use a 2D Array…..

To get an 80, the mines are not random, but the 2-D array contains 40 “mines,” and all the values of the other spots contain the number that it is touching….. Users can pick spots to open, and it is displayed correctly.  The game ends when a bomb is picked. 


To get a 92, it is the same as a 85, but random mines and the user can “mark” bombs.


To get a 100, same as 92, but it opens when a 0 is clicked.
