You will be creating WORDLE….well sort of…no graphics and you don’t need to check to see if the user
enters a real word.

The game starts by someone first entering a Wordle word. You must check that they have entered a 5
letter word….if not you need to prompt the user for a new Wordle.

Then….make sure there are “enters” so that a second player can’t see the Wordle entered. They are to
guess. Again, check to make sure it is 5 letters. Then you will output something like the following
Y _ _ _ _
_ Y Y Y _
Y Y _ Y Y
Y _ G G Y
G _ G G Y
G G G G G (and then some message that they got the right word).

The user has up to 6 questions…..
There is more than meets the eye here and I will add on a rubric next week.
